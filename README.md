## Running the tests
The streamlit app is seperated into 4 tabs: Upload video, Live feed, Validation tab and About tab. The upload video tab is used to upload a video and run the eulerian magnification on the video. The live feed tab is used to run the eulerian magnification on a live feed from the webcam. The validation tab is used to validate the heart rate detection on a video and compare with other methods. The about tab is used to get information about the project and the authors and a link to this github page.
